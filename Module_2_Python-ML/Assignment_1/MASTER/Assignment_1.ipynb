    "(4h) Move your problem to three dimensions and write a new set of functions. That is, generate points in a 3-dimensional cube, and take the ratio of the volumes between a sphere enclosed within a cube and find a relationship to solve for $\\pi$. Use the ratio of the number of points in the sphere to the ratio of the number of points in the cube as an estimate of the ratio between their volumes (how does checking whether a point is in the sphere different from checking whether a point is in the circle?). Write a method that takes in $n$ number of points to generate and outputs an estimate of $\\pi$. Plot the same type of plot as you did in (4f) but utilizing the three dimensional problem. Consider the same efficient implementation you made in (4g) and try to implement it in the three-dimensional version. Overlay the results of the best implementation in two-dimensions and the results of the best implementation in three-dimensions (accuracy in estimating $\\pi$ against the number of points generated).\n",
